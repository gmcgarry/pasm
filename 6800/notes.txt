Motorola 6800/6802/6805/6808/6809

Backend originated from ACK sources.

- 6800 original
- 6802 added:
	- 128B internal RAM
	- 16-bit index register H:X
	- 16-bit relative stack instructions
	- on-chip clock circuit
- 6808 is 6802 without internal RAM disabled
- 6805 removed B accumulator
	- contains ROM and I/O on single chip
	- successor to the 6804
- 6809 16-bit aritmetic, stack registers, PIC instructions

MC6800:

- 8-bit data bus
- 16-bit address bus (64KB RAM)
- 6 registers:
	- A: 8-bit accumulator
	- B: 8-bit accumulator
	- IX: 16-bit index register
	- SP: 16-bit stack pointer
	- PC: 16-bit program counter
	- CCR: 8-bit condition code register (x x H I N Z V C)
		- H=half carry, I=interrupt mask, N=negative, Z=zero, V=overflow, C=carry

MC6808
	- 16-bit index register H:X
	- 16-bit SP register
	- 16-bit PC

MC6805/MC908:

- 8-bit data bus
- 8-bit address bus (256B RAM)
- 8K program memory
- 6805 (NMOS), 146805 (CMOS), 68HC05 (HCMOS)
- CMOS and HCMOS have additional instructions for bit manipulation
- stack located at top of zero page and grows down; max size 64 bytes
- 5 registers: (no B accumulator)
	- A: 8-bit accumulator
	- X: 8-bit index register
	- SP: 6-bit stack pointer (bit 6 wired to 1)
	- PC: 13-bit program counter
	- CCR: 8-bit condition-code register (x x x H I N Z C)
		- H=half carry, I=interrupt mask, N=negative, Z=zero, C=carry
- adds bit operations
- interrupts save all registers on the stack: PCL, PCH, X, A, CCR
